I am a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Mathematics, <a href="https://www.massey.ac.nz/massey/explore/departments/institute-fundamental-sciences/institute-fundamental-sciences_home.cfm">School of Fundamental Sciences</a> at Massey University, Palmerston North. My PI is <a href="https://www.massey.ac.nz/~djwsimps/">Dr. David Simpson</a>. My research interests lie in application of dynamical systems theory to practical problems, including neuroscience and cardiovascular systems. 

My PhD research was on spatiotemporal pattern formation in a model of coupled pacemaker smooth muscle cells. Before joining Massey, I received an MSc in Mathematical Sciences from African Institute for Mathematical Sciences in Ghana and a B.Tech in Industrial Mathematics from the Federal University of Technology, Akure in Nigeria. I also had a diploma in Statistics from the Federal Polytechnic Ede in Osun State, Nigeria.
