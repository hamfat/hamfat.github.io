Welcome to my homepage. I am a doctoral candidate in the School of Fundamental Sciences at Massey University in Palmerston North, New Zealand. My research interests lie in application of dynamical systems theory to practical problems. My current research focus is on spatiotemporal pattern formation in a model of coupled pacemaker smooth muscle cells. 

-Research Description
Different patterns have been observed in nature and living systems, but the mechanisms behind many of these patterns are still unknown; the process is very complex in nature. My research will focus on pattern formation in excitable media like neurons and smooth muscle cells. Excitability of cells occurs as a result of control of the cell volume which causes differences in the concentration of ions (for example calcium, potassium, sodium) across the cell membrane, which generates a potential difference across the cell membrane that causes the flow of ionic currents through the ionic channels. This process is modelled mathematically using ordinary differential equations. Our aim is to study the interactions within many cells and how spatiotemporal patterns are formed between many cells. Diffusion and transport of ions between cells are considered; therefore reaction-diffusion equations are used in modelling such problems. However, some of the parameters for the equations may well differ between cells, due to, for example, proximity to some signalling source, which may be a cause of spatiotemporal pattern formation. Hence in this research work, we aim to develop mathematical techniques to study reaction-diffusion systems with spatial parameter variation.

Before joining Massey, I received an MSc in Mathematical Sciences from African Institute for Mathematical Sciences in Ghana and a B. Tech in Industrial Mathematics from Federal University of Technology, Akure in Nigeria. I also had a diploma in Statistics from the Federal Polytechnic Ede in Osun State, Nigeria.
