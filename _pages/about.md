Welcome to my homepage. I am a doctoral candidate in the School of Fundamental Sciences at Massey University in Palmerston North, New Zealand. My research interests lie in application of dynamical systems theory to practical problems. My current research focus is on spatiotemporal pattern formation in a model of coupled pacemaker smooth muscle cells. 

Before joining Massey, I received an MSc in Mathematical Sciences from African Institute for Mathematical Sciences in Ghana and a B.Tech in Industrial Mathematics from the Federal University of Technology, Akure in Nigeria. I also had a diploma in Statistics from the Federal Polytechnic Ede in Osun State, Nigeria.

Research Interest

Mathematical physiology, Pattern formation theory, Dynamical systems, Disease modelling, Solitons
