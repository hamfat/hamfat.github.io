I am a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Mathematics, <a href="https://www.massey.ac.nz/massey/explore/departments/institute-fundamental-sciences/institute-fundamental-sciences_home.cfm">School of Fundamental Sciences</a> at Massey University, Palmerston North. My PI is <a href="https://www.massey.ac.nz/~djwsimps/">Dr. David Simpson</a>. My research interests lie in application of dynamical systems theory to practical problems, including neuroscience and cardiovascular systems. 

My PhD research was on mathematical analysis of the physiology of excitable cells, in particular smooth muscle cells. I used bifurcation theory to study electrophysiological activities in a single cell. I analysed the collective behaviour of the smooth muscle cells through gap junction coupling between adjacent cells. The results showed that coupled cells can exhibit irregular spiking of action potentials.

Before joining Massey, I received an MSc in Mathematical Sciences from African Institute for Mathematical Sciences in Ghana and a B.Tech in Industrial Mathematics from the Federal University of Technology, Akure in Nigeria. I also had a diploma in Statistics from the Federal Polytechnic Ede in Osun State, Nigeria.
