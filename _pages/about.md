I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the <a href="https://www.massey.ac.nz/massey/learning/departments/centres-research/epicentre/epicentre_home.cfm">EpiCentre -- School of Veterinary Science</a> at Massey University, Palmerston North. My research interests lie in application of dynamical systems theory to practical problems, including neuroscience, cardiovascular systems, and epidemiology. 

Recently, I worked on robust chaos in switched dynamical systems in relation to the project titled “Organised chaos: Using geometry to explain robust chaotic dynamics in switched dynamical systems”. My principal investigator was <a href="https://www.massey.ac.nz/~djwsimps/">Dr David J. W. Simpson</a>. The project was funded through the <a href="https://www.royalsociety.org.nz/what-we-do/funds-and-opportunities/marsden/awarded-grants/marsden-fund-awards-2018/">Royal Society of NZ Marsden Fund</a>.

My PhD research was on mathematical analysis of the physiology of excitable cells, in particular smooth muscle cells. I used bifurcation theory to study electrophysiological activities in a single cell and analysed the collective behaviour of the smooth muscle cells through gap junction coupling between adjacent cells. The results showed that coupled cells can exhibit irregular spiking of action potentials. My supervisors are <a href="https://www.massey.ac.nz/massey/expertise/profile.cfm?stref=630350">Dr Richard G.

Before joining Massey, I received an MSc in Mathematical Sciences from African Institute for Mathematical Sciences in Ghana and a B.Tech in Industrial Mathematics from the Federal University of Technology, Akure in Nigeria. I also had a diploma in Statistics from the Federal Polytechnic Ede in Osun State, Nigeria.
