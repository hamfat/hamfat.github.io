Abstract: Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral infection caused by the dengue viruses of four serotypes, DENV-1,2,3,4. The disease is transmitted by the bites of infected female Aedes mosquitoes. This paper presents a compartmental deterministic model including human prevention and vector control interventions for the dynamics of dengue fever spread. Theoretical analysis of the model is conducted to obtain the associated dengue-free equilibrium. The next generation matrix method is used to calculate the effective reproduction number. The local stability analysis of the dengue-free equilibrium is presented. Numerical simulations of different strategies of control combination are considered, and how they impact the dynamical behaviour of the system are analysed. We found that dengue prevalence can be reduced in a community by implementing any control intervention which combines human prevention and vector control measures.
