Abstract: Pacemaker dynamics is the spontaneous excitation-contraction coupling in muscle cells. It may arise as a result of interaction between ion fluxes through the voltage-gated ion channels. In this work, we consider a model of electrically coupled pacemaker smooth muscle cells to investigate the formation of spatiotemporal patterns. We analyse the behaviour of an isolated smooth muscle cell using numerical bifurcation analysis. By modulating model parameters, the result reveals transitions between Type I and II excitabilities in the parameter space. Numerical simulations of our model show that the pattern can bifurcate from been stable to spatiotemporal chaos.
