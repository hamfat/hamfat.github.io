Abstract: In this work we consider a modified Morris-Lecar model by incorporating the sodium inward current. We investigate in detail the influence of sodium current conductance and potassium current conductance on the dynamical behaviour of the modified model. Variation of sodium current conductance changes the dynamics qualitatively. We perform a numerical bifurcation analysis of the model with sodium and potassium current conductances as bifurcation parameters. The bifurcation of solutions varying sodium current conductance produces complex bifurcation structure that is not present in the existing results of original Morris-Lecar model.
